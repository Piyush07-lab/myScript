# myScript
This is just a repo of me learning JS...and ofc doing some experiments

I'm learning JavaScript one basic at a time. My aim is to not just get better at using js but rather understanding it to higher level. That way I can not only make stuff that already exist but also build things from scratch. 
This repo is an evergoing one because I think, I won't be finished with this anytime soon. In fact, I'm hoping to never get bored of this language. 
JavaScript is an amazing language and I'm having a ton of fun in lerning and trying to work with it. See, I'm still just trying to work with it. Once I have learnt enough, I'll start by making a personal portfolio. With all the things I've planned. A proper website to present myself.
I know, Personal portfolio is something that people don't even see probably. But still, if I want to make it noone can stop me. I've always wanted to make stuffs or create stuffs. Weather it is hardware or software, it doesn't matter. Creating something matters! I finally got this!


[I finally am working mid- hard right now (I will update my working intensity ocassionly, as of now this is what I think I'm doing relative to how much I think I should work). But I'll be working even harder now from the next day. (13/06/2025 this part will be edited everyday)]
